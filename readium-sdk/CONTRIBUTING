The Readium SDK is available under two licenses.  In order to encourage
tangible contributions from commercial parties, we have chosen to release the source
code under a copyleft license for the time being, while making a separate,
commercially-exploitable license available to anyone who commits significant
resources and signs a contribution and copyright assignment agreement.

Under the terms of the GPL, anyone may fork and modify this project, and may
distribute their modifications in source and binary form under version 3 or later of
the GPL.  Note, however, that for any such modifications to be contributed back to
the main project their copyright must be assigned to the Readium Foundation.  Only
code whose copyright has been thus assigned will be considered for inclusion.
